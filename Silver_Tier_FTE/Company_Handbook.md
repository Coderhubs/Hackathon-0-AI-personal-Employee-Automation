# Company Handbook

## Strict Operating Rules

### Planning Rule
Before executing ANY task, you must first create a file in /Plans named Plan_[TaskName].md outlining your steps.

### LinkedIn Skill
If a file mentions "AI" or "Tech", draft a professional LinkedIn post. Do NOT output the post to /Done. Instead, save it as a file in /Pending_Approval named DRAFT_Post_[Topic].md.

### Gmail Skill
If a file mentions "GMAIL_", draft a professional response email. Do NOT output the response to /Done. Instead, save it as a file in /Pending_Approval named DRAFT_Response_[Subject].md.

### HITL Rule
Never move files to /Done unless the necessary steps in the Plan are checked off.
