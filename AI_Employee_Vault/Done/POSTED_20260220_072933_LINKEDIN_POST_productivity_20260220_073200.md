💡 The 3-Minute Rule for Email Management

I used to spend 2+ hours daily on emails. Now it's 30 minutes.

Here's what changed:

🔹 If it takes < 3 minutes → Do it now
🔹 If it needs thought → Schedule a block
🔹 If it's FYI → Archive immediately
🔹 If it's not urgent → Batch for later

The secret? Stop treating your inbox like a to-do list.

Your inbox is a communication channel, not a task manager.

Result after 3 months:
✅ 70% less email stress
✅ Faster response times
✅ More focus time for deep work

What's your email management strategy?
