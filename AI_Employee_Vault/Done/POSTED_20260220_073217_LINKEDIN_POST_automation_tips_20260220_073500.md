🎯 Why Most Automation Projects Fail (And How to Fix It)

After implementing 50+ automation projects, I've noticed a pattern:

❌ Common mistakes:
• Starting with complex processes
• No clear ROI metrics
• Skipping the pilot phase
• Automating broken processes

✅ What actually works:
• Start small, scale fast
• Pick high-volume, low-complexity tasks
• Measure everything
• Fix the process BEFORE automating

Pro tip: If a human struggles with it, a bot will too.

The best automation candidates:
→ Repetitive
→ Rule-based
→ High volume
→ Low exception rate

Start with one process. Perfect it. Then scale.

What's your automation success story?
