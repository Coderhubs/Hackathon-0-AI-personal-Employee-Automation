Hi Simra,

Great question about Claude CLI productivity in 2026!

Claude CLI is becoming more productive through several key improvements:

**1. Extended Thinking Mode**
- Deeper reasoning capabilities for complex problems
- Better code analysis and debugging

**2. Agent Skills System**
- Custom skills for specialized tasks
- Automated workflows with human approval

**3. MCP (Model Context Protocol)**
- Connect to external tools and APIs
- Access databases, cloud services, and more

**4. Improved Context Management**
- Better handling of large codebases
- Smarter file navigation and search

**5. Autonomous Agents**
- Background task execution
- Continuous monitoring and automation

This AI Personal Employee system you're seeing is a perfect example - it monitors Gmail, LinkedIn, and WhatsApp 24/7, processes incoming messages, and drafts responses automatically!

Would you like to know more about any specific feature?

Best regards,
AI Personal Employee System
