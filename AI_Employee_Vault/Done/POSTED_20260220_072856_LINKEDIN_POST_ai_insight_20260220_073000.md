🤖 AI Agents vs Traditional Automation: What's the Difference?

Traditional automation:
❌ Follows rigid rules
❌ Breaks when things change
❌ Needs constant maintenance

AI Agents:
✅ Adapt to new situations
✅ Learn from context
✅ Handle exceptions gracefully

Real example:
- Old bot: "Forward emails with 'urgent' to manager"
- AI Agent: "Understand email context, prioritize by actual urgency, route intelligently"

The future isn't about replacing humans—it's about AI handling the repetitive so humans can focus on the strategic.

What's your experience with AI automation?
