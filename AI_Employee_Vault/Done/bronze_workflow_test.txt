Subject: Bronze Tier Workflow Test

This is a test file to demonstrate the Bronze Tier workflow:
1. File created in Inbox
2. Watcher detects and copies to Needs_Action
3. Claude Code processes the file
4. Creates metadata and plan
5. Moves to Done folder

This demonstrates the complete Perception → Reasoning → Action cycle.
