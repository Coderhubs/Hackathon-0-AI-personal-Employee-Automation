📚 3 Mistakes I Made Building AI Automation

Mistake #1: Automating broken processes
→ Lesson: Fix the process FIRST, then automate
→ Bad process + automation = faster bad results

Mistake #2: No human oversight
→ Lesson: Always keep human-in-the-loop for critical decisions
→ AI is smart, but context matters

Mistake #3: Over-engineering
→ Lesson: Start simple, scale gradually
→ Perfect is the enemy of done

What worked instead:
✅ Start with one simple task
✅ Test thoroughly
✅ Measure results
✅ Iterate and improve
✅ Scale what works

Result: 90% success rate vs 30% when I tried to automate everything at once.

The best automation is the one that actually gets used.

What's your biggest automation lesson?
