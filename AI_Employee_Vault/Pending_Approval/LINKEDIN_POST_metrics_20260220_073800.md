📊 Data I Wish I'd Tracked From Day One

3 years into my business, I realized I was flying blind.

Here's what I track now (and you should too):

1️⃣ Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)
→ How much to get one customer?

2️⃣ Customer Lifetime Value (LTV)
→ How much is each customer worth?

3️⃣ Response Time Metrics
→ How fast do we reply?

4️⃣ Task Completion Rate
→ What % of tasks finish on time?

5️⃣ Revenue Per Hour
→ Which activities actually make money?

The insight? 20% of my activities generated 80% of revenue.

I cut the rest. Revenue doubled.

You can't improve what you don't measure.

What's the one metric that changed your business?
