⚡ The 2-Hour Rule That Changed My Business

I used to work 12-hour days and still felt behind.

Then I discovered the 2-Hour Rule:

Every morning, 2 hours of:
→ No meetings
→ No emails
→ No Slack
→ No interruptions

Just deep work on ONE important task.

What changed:
✅ Finished projects 3x faster
✅ Better quality work
✅ Less stress
✅ More creative solutions

The secret?
Your brain is freshest in the morning.
Use it for thinking, not reacting.

Save emails and meetings for afternoon.
Save your best hours for your best work.

Result: 10x more value in 2 focused hours than 8 distracted hours.

What's your most productive time of day?
