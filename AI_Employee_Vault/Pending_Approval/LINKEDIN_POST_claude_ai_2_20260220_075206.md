🧠 Building with Claude AI: Lessons Learned

After 3 months of building AI automation with Claude:

What worked:
✅ Long context (200K tokens) = complex workflows
✅ Code generation = production-ready scripts
✅ Reasoning ability = handles edge cases
✅ Safety features = refuses harmful requests

What surprised me:
→ Claude understands business context better than expected
→ Generates better code than I could write manually
→ Explains decisions clearly (great for debugging)
→ Consistent outputs (no random hallucinations)

Real impact:
• 80% faster development
• Fewer bugs
• Better architecture
• More maintainable code

Claude isn't just an AI tool—it's a development partner.

What's your experience with AI coding assistants?
