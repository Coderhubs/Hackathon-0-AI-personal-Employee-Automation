🚀 Introducing: AI Personal Employee

I built an AI that works 24/7 so I don't have to.

What it does:
📧 Monitors Gmail for urgent emails
💼 Responds to LinkedIn messages
📱 Tracks social media mentions
📊 Generates daily reports
✅ Handles routine tasks automatically

How it works:
1. AI watches all communication channels
2. Identifies urgent items using Claude AI
3. Creates draft responses for approval
4. Executes approved actions
5. Logs everything for audit

Tech Stack:
→ Claude AI (reasoning engine)
→ Python (automation)
→ Playwright (browser automation)
→ MCP Servers (integrations)

Results after 30 days:
✅ 5 hours saved daily
✅ Zero missed opportunities
✅ Faster response times
✅ Better work-life balance

This isn't science fiction. It's available now.
