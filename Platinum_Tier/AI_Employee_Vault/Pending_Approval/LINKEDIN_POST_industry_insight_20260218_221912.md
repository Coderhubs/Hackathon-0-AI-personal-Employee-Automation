🤔 The Digital FTE Shift

We're moving from:
"How many employees do you have?"

To:
"How many Digital FTEs are working for you?"

A Digital FTE:
• Works 24/7 (8,760 hours/year vs 2,000)
• Costs 85% less per task
• Never needs training
• Scales instantly

The question isn't "if" anymore.
It's "how fast can you deploy?"
