Mock Watchers Control Guide
============================

Your mock watchers are currently running in the background!

CURRENT STATUS:
--------------
- Gmail Watcher: Task ID b2e0e40 (creates email every 3 min)
- LinkedIn Watcher: Task ID b2a75e8 (creates post every 2 min)
- Files created so far: 88+ (40 Gmail, 48 LinkedIn)
- Location: Platinum_Tier/Inbox/

HOW TO STOP THE WATCHERS:
-------------------------

Method 1: Stop by Task ID
--------------------------
# Stop Gmail watcher
taskkill /F /PID <process_id>

# Stop LinkedIn watcher
taskkill /F /PID <process_id>

Method 2: Stop all Python processes (nuclear option)
-----------------------------------------------------
taskkill /F /IM python.exe

Method 3: Find and kill specific processes
-------------------------------------------
# List all Python processes
tasklist | findstr python

# Kill specific PID
taskkill /F /PID <pid_number>

HOW TO CHECK IF THEY'RE STILL RUNNING:
--------------------------------------
# Check for new files
ls -lt Platinum_Tier/Inbox | head -5

# If files are still being created, watchers are running
# If no new files after 3 minutes, they've stopped

WHAT HAPPENS TO THESE FILES:
----------------------------
Your AI Employee system should:
1. Monitor the Inbox/ folder for new files
2. Read each file when it appears
3. Process the content (email/post)
4. Take appropriate action based on content
5. Move processed files to an archive folder

EXAMPLE WORKFLOW:
-----------------
1. Gmail watcher creates: GMAIL_20260208_123456_Invoice.txt
2. Your AI Employee detects the new file
3. Reads: "Invoice: Monthly Subscription"
4. Processes: Extracts invoice details
5. Actions:
   - Logs to accounting system
   - Sends notification
   - Archives the file

NEXT STEPS:
-----------

Option A: Let them run and test your AI Employee system
   - Keep watchers running
   - Test if your system processes the files
   - Monitor logs for activity

Option B: Stop them and switch to real watchers
   - Stop mock watchers
   - Configure .env with real credentials
   - Run gmail_watcher_playwright.py
   - Run linkedin_watcher_playwright.py

Option C: Stop them for now
   - Stop both watchers
   - Clean up Inbox folder if needed
   - Restart when ready to test

USEFUL COMMANDS:
----------------

# Count files by type
ls Inbox/GMAIL_* | wc -l
ls Inbox/LINKEDIN_* | wc -l

# Show latest 10 files
ls -lt Inbox | head -10

# Watch for new files in real-time (Windows)
dir /O-D Inbox

# Clean up old test files (careful!)
rm Inbox/GMAIL_*
rm Inbox/LINKEDIN_*

LOGS LOCATION:
--------------
Gold_Tier/Logs/gmail_watcher.log
Gold_Tier/Logs/linkedin_watcher.log

Check logs to see watcher activity and any errors.

TROUBLESHOOTING:
----------------

Watchers stopped unexpectedly:
- Check logs for errors
- Verify Inbox folder exists
- Check disk space
- Restart watchers

Too many files created:
- Stop watchers
- Clean up Inbox folder
- Adjust timing in watcher code

Files not being processed:
- Check your AI Employee system is running
- Verify file monitoring is enabled
- Check permissions on Inbox folder

PERFORMANCE NOTES:
------------------
- Mock watchers use minimal CPU/memory
- Each file is ~200-300 bytes
- 88 files = ~20 KB total
- Can run indefinitely without issues
- Safe to leave running for testing

READY FOR PRODUCTION?
---------------------
When you're ready to use real data:
1. Stop mock watchers
2. Edit .env with real credentials
3. Run: python gmail_watcher_playwright.py
4. Run: python linkedin_watcher_playwright.py
5. Monitor for real emails/posts

The real watchers work exactly the same way,
but fetch actual data from Gmail and LinkedIn!
